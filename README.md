The purpose of this project is to give fans an interactive tool to utilize when filling out their brackets. The data comes from kenpom.com, a respected advanced basketball analytics website that is now used by the NCAA selection committee when seeding teams for the tournament.

Navigate through the website and uncover your own hidden trends. You can find:

Detailed profiles on all 353 teams for every year since 2010
A page to compare any two teams since 2010
An interactive scatter plot allowing you to filter over 36 different statistical fields
Ability to compare a team against past final four and championship teams
A reference page explaining each of the statistics
